                <h3><div id="00"></div><span>00</span> Introduction</h3>
                <hr>

                Throughout this related study I hope to explain how liminal spaces can be used in art, while also learning more about them to further expand on my art. From this, I will be looking into what liminal spaces are, and how they have changed and grown into a wider set of categories over time. I also hope to convey (with examples) how liminal spaces can be used to convey a feeling of lethologica through the familiarity being overwhelmed by the looming unknown created in such spaces.


                <br><br>
                <h3><div id="01"></div><span>01</span> What are liminal spaces</h3>
                <hr>
                Liminal space is an aesthetic taken from the academic definition of liminality, which as an adjective means: <span>‘occupying a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold’ and ‘relating to a transitional or initial stage of a process’<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/liminality" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="definition of liminality">[1]</a></span> where this definition was created further from the words etymology in which the word liminal was derived from that latin word ‘limen’ which translated to ‘threshold’.  This subsequent idea of a transitional state is what gives liminal space both an isolated, yet familiar feeling to each environment.<br><br>

                This feeling is best described in the book ‘Liminality and Transitional Phenomena’ in which the author states liminality as being a muddle in which <span>‘the space between the literal/contractual side of analysis and the psychic/symbolic as-if side, creates a hazard for the entire analytic enterprise’<a class="sourcer" name="Liminality and Transitional Phenomena">[2]</a></span>. From this, we can see that even scientific views on the nature of liminality are directly seen as a mixture between the current ‘now’ and the latter ‘then’. With the ‘now’ being represented by the literal and concrete present that has already existed, and the ‘then’ being represented by the chaos of an impossible rendition of what our minds perceive to be the future. This transition is created by the feelings and thoughts created from the movement between these thoughts in our minds.<br><br>

The newer and more prominent version of liminal space today is modern liminal space which involves far more than just the idea of a transitional space. Modern liminal space can also involve environments that relay a dreamlike or nostalgic feeling across to the viewer through an almost landscape driven <span>uncanny valley<a class="sourcer" name="human-like appearance of a robotic object and the emotional response it evokes">[?]</a></span>. Although most of the differences between the initial idea of liminal space and the modern idea of liminal space share many similarities, modern liminal space has grown enough to warrant the aesthetic being split into subcategories of liminal spaces that push a representation of a specific feeling to the viewer. These subcategories of modern liminal space are referred to as ‘cores’ and they aim to further pinpoint the feelings that liminal space can produce.

                <h3><div id="02"></div><span>02</span> What makes liminal spaces unsettling</h3>
                <hr>
                Although liminal space isn't seen as scary, it is widely accepted as being able to  give off an eerie and unsettling aura to any image that depicts liminality.<br>
But why is this?<br>
The absence of specific characteristics that are commonly considered to be present in each environment can end up leading the location to feel unsettling due to the lack of the usual stimuli that would otherwise be present and observable. A popular example of this is photos of indoor swimming pools that are taken after closing time.<br> <img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/liminal_pool_normal.jpg" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

This photo, although just a regular swimming pool, is an example of a liminal space photo caused by a lack of expected stimuli. For example, the lack of lighting and absence of people end up giving this photo an unexpectedly eerie atmosphere.<br>

This feeling can then be further induced by warping and changing expected elements in the scene in order to make even the recognisable parts of an environment feel distant. By doing this, you can create a falsified sense of nostalgia as although the environment feels familiar, it has been tweaked just enough to also make it feel foreign to us which causes a lethologica like effect. This effect is shown in a similar indoor swimming pool which has additional mushroom props which count towards the lethologica feeling.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/liminal_flow.gif" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

So now that we know when familiarity is mixed with missing stimuli and warped environments it creates a liminal and nostalgic feeling, what would it be like if we fabricated these environments using art?<br>

The feelings exerted by liminal space have been replicated in many different art mediums with varying levels of detail.<br>

The most prominent liminal space artist is <span>Jared Pike<a href="https://www.jaredpike.art/" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="New York City based designer and artist">[?]</a></span> who is known for creating the ‘dream pool’ art with <span>Blender<a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="3D modelling software">[?]</a></span>. This art depicts a labyrinth like swimming pool which seems to span endlessly through a series of twisting corridors and abstract rooms that have no reason to exist, yet have been brought to life by the artist. <br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/liminal_pool.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>


Other types of liminal space art are done with paintings where the perspective has been intentionally warped in order to give the empty space the reality altered feeling, thus inflicting the previously mentioned lethologica like effect. A good example of this is <span>Ferdinanda Florence<a href="https://ferdinanda.com/" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="Acrylic painter">[?]</a></span> who created a series of acrylic paintings that involve environments that are usually full of foot traffic being devoid of any people. This lack of human appearance paired with the lack of lineart and fisheye perspective of each building and landscape leads to each painting to bear resemblance to old distorted analogue photos.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/liminal_building.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

Each of these art pieces are also benefited by the idea of misophonia. <span>Misophonia<a class="sourcer" name="People affected emotionally by common sounds">[?]</a></span> is a condition where people are emotionally affected by sounds that aren't usually paid attention to by most people. However in this case the liminal space art can benefit from this, as due to the lack of common visual stimuli that can be observed in the scene, our minds might try and fill in the blanks by imagining what audible stimuli would instead be heard in each environment. For example the light humming from a water pump and the occasional drip of a water droplet that could possibly be heard in the indoor swimming pool examples.

                <h3><div id="03"></div><span>03</span> How liminal space links to other cores</h3>
                <hr>

                As previously mentioned, as the idea of liminal imagery has expanded, it has been split into different categories that try to elicit different emotions called ‘cores’. ‘liminal space’ is used to reference the original liminal space themes rather than the new branching cores that have been created. An example of some of these cores are: 

                <br><br>
                
                <h5><div></div>Dreamcore</h5>

                Dreamcore is an aesthetic built on top of liminal spaces that tries to provide imagery that provides a dream-like incoherence to every space that gets layered upon. This is achieved through its initial liminal space that is devoid of people being combined with bright pastel colours and impossible environments such as a house in which every door and window leads to the sky. Extra layers of distortion are often added on top of these ideas to further push the feeling of a dream-like environment.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/dreamcore.jpg" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

                Dreamcore, although a more vibrant and bright version of liminal space, does have a few recurring themes that can be unsettling to the viewer of the art. One of these recurring elements in Dreamcore is photorealistic eyes plastered across many of the artworks that fall under the category.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/dreamcore_eyes.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                
                Although themes with eyes and other photo realistic elements such as mouths and teeth are common in Dreamcore, it isn't meant to create any feelings of dread, but rather emulate the strange scenarios and feelings one could experience within a dream itself.
                
                <br><br>
                
                <h5><div></div>Weirdcore</h5>

                Similarly to Dreamcore, Weirdcore is built on top of liminal imagery however, unlike with dreamcore, Weirdcore specifically tries to draw out feelings of dread and <span>anemoia<a class="sourcer" name="Nostalgia for a time or a place one has never known">[?]</a></span> on top of the feelings achieved through the use of a liminal space. It is also referred to as a <span>‘surrealist aesthetic’<a class="sourcer" name="Aesthetics Wiki" href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Weirdcore">[3]</a></span> by the community that surrounds it. Weirdcore also intercepts with elements of Traumacore as some of the imagery can represent the mental health damage caused by trauma with the use of unsettling imagery paired with liminal space elements that are accompanied by silhouettes and text.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/weirdcore.jpg" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

                Weirdcore uses a much more surreal approach to its imagery compared to the original liminal space, but it still tries to keep the environments devoid of natural environments and cohesion. This style is especially inspired by the 2000s early digital graphics which is evident by the low quality graphics and use of chromatic aberration in order to give each image a VHS style effect. Further distortion like blurring or oversaturated colours are also common due to the fight or flight-esque response the artwork tries to generate.

                <h3><div id="04"></div><span>04</span> Artwork created from research</h3>
                <hr>
                

                <h5><div id="41"></div>OMOCAT</h5>

                    My first introduction to liminal space was through a digital artist and game developer named OMOCAT, in which they used a Dreamcore aesthetic in order to promote their game labelled ‘OMORI’. ‘OMORI’ later explores a similar style to Weirdcore as the game progresses and delves deeper into the characters' suppressed trauma. OMOCAT does this by distorting cartoonish imagery into a dread inducing piece that feeds off of the viewers childhood memories of bright and colourful drawings, further adding to the affect of the piece.<br><img class="colourimage" src="icon/essayimgs/omori_dreamcore.jpg" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    Before I looked more into liminality and the different cores, I tried experimenting with a cartoonish style that is tainted by an exterior entity closing in on the character to try and replicate the style without knowing that it fell under the Weirdcore category.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/omori_port.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    After this, I once again made art of ’OMORI’ but this time I looked into the background of Weirdcore and Dreamcore in order to improve my experimentation to match the type of art ‘OMORI’ was intended to be. To do this, I used a range of imagery from photorealistic elements placed on top of cartoonish ones, to scribbled shadows and eyes that are indicative of the Weirdcore style. By placing these elements in a place devoid of colour and substance I hoped to achieve the same liminal feeling that is hidden beneath Weirdcore.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/omori.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

                <h5><div id="42"></div>Kisaragi Station</h5>
                    
                    By compiling all of the causes of liminal space and the different effects and styles of the cores, I tried to make an animation based on liminal space, or rather an urban legend about a liminal space. While creating the animation I added different liminal space aspects into each scene. However I specifically tried to use elements from Weirdcore liminality.<br><br>
                    
                    Firstly: I created VHS like chromatic aberration and film grain filter to put over the entire animation to make it fit with Weirdcore distortion, while pairing the hand drawn elements with photorealistic images to increase the feeling of disorder within the piece.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/station.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    Secondly: I used a warped two-point perspective to give the station an unnaturally bending look, while also having the stations platforms extend infinitely into the distance.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/sign.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    Thirdly: I used the disembodied eyes of the character to fit with Weirdcores style and uncanny nature. These eyes, alongside the characters design, are created to be abstract to fit into the nature of Weirdcore<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/eye.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    Fourthly: I used the body of a real person with their face blocked out to create an effect similar to the faceless silhouettes that can be seen in Weirdcore art.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/girl.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>
                    
                    Finally: I fully used the idea of a transparent silhouette with ominous text next to it which helped to replicate the mysterious feeling that can be found in Weirdcore art that contains transparent silhouettes of people.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/ghost.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>


                <h5><div id="43"></div>Liminal experimentation</h5>
                    
                    I then decided to focus solely on weirdcore for the next piece I created. This art was based off of the strange text that usually surrounds the images based on the weirdcore aesthetic and out of place messages that don't fit with the normal environmental expectations that come with the scene shown to the viewer.<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/portimg/alevel/14.png" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

                    For this piece, I placed the sign on a chain link fence that covers an endlessly dark scene. The sign itself conveys the principle of weirdcore through using a message that doesn't fit with any possible scenario, but rather conveys the severity of an unknown and impossible situation to the viewer and from this, distorting the users perception of the current situation at hand. I got the idea of using signs to convey the message of weirdcore images from other weirdcore images of the same nature, for example:<br><img class="colourimage"  src="icon/essayimgs/weirdcore sign.jpg" alt="headers" draggable="false"><br>

                    In most cases similar to these two images, the themes of the message passed along by the signs usually represent the previously mentioned feeling of <span>anemoia<a class="sourcer" name="Nostalgia for a time or a place one has never known">[?]</a></span> or more accurately, they prey on the idea that these spaces created inside of liminality may invoke a sense of déjà vu which adds a larger impact to the message being conveyed.
                <br><br>

                <h3><div id="05"></div><span>05</span> Conclusion</h3>

                To conclude, the overall concept of liminality has morphed from what it once was, and overtime has become a wider scope of different genres that hold different meanings and convey different emotions to the viewer. Because of this, liminality is incredibly useful as a concept for use in art, as you can invoke a strong sense of nostalgia through the use of liminal spaces which can lead to a higher viewer response.
