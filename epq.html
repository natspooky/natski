                Websites are composed of many different languages in order to style, structure and run different features both client side and server side. The languages used can be split into two main categories which consist of the ‘frontend’ and ‘backend’ where the frontend is the design and functionality of the client side layout, whereas the backend is the server processing and database of the website.<br>

                The frontend consists of 3 main languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. These all contribute to the creation of the visual and client side processing of the website.<br><br>
                
                <img class="left" src="icon/essayimgs/html.png" alt="html" draggable="false">

                The central connective language for frontend development is HTML; which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <span>'HTML 1.0 was first written in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee'<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="No information given">[?]</a></span>, which has since been expanded upon until HTML 4.01 became the official standard in December 1999 at which point version 4.01 became the most widely used version of the architecture at the time. <span>'XHTML 1.0 (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)'<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="No information given">[?]</a></span> was written shortly after HTML 4.01 in 2000, and was designed to combine both the power of XML and the current strength of HTML 4, this was a stricter but ultimately the same version of HTML, however it was the only way to have both HTML and XML. the requirement of XHTML if developers wanted both HTML and XML was removed in 2015 when HTML 5 was released, HTML 5 was designed solely in order to be able to replace all previous versions of HTML and XHTML in order to make all the needed features of both available while adding major improvements for both, such as more elements and optimisation to video and audio capability. HTML 5 is now considered an official web standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) who now maintain and continue developing HTML to add more functionality to the language.<br>
                
                HTML is not considered a programming language due to its inability to create dynamic functionality. ‘But why do we need HTML?’ Although HTML isn't a programming language, HTML is needed for structuring page content, inserting links to other pages or websites and connecting other languages together through itself, thus it is just as needed as Javascript or CSS. Each page of a website, whether it's a home page, about page or contact page, still requires a separate HTML document for each.<br>
                
                All HTML pages will contain a series of elements through the culmination of tags and attributes within. Elements are what structures a webpage through placement of tags and attributes that assign meaning to each tag. Tags tell the browser where an element will begin and end but an attribute will describe the characteristics of the element. Tags are structured with an opening tag, content and closing tag, for example a paragraph would be shown as:
                
                <div class="code">&lt;p> This is text inside of a paragraph &lt;/p></div>

                Every element follows this layout in the format of:

                <div class="code">&lt;[tag name]> [element content] &lt;/[tag name]></div>

                The closing tag in html always has a forward slash after the opening bracket in order to tell the browser that this is where an element ends. This is important because in HTML you can have multiple elements embedded inside of a single element, meaning that without the ending tag the browser could misinterpret the embedded element as a closing tag and drastically change the elements function. This rule has a few exceptions however as some elements only have an opening tag such as image tags, meta tags and line break tags.

                <div class="code">&lt;[name of single tag element]></div>

                Single tag elements exist as they cannot contain content or tags within themselves which makes the closing tag redundant when used, However both tag types use attributes. Attributes are vital to tags which add more information and detail. Attributes are formatted in tags as:

                <div class="code">&lt;[tag name] [attribute name]=”[attribute value]”> [content of element] &lt;/[tag name]></div>
                
                Attributes can give links to images through ‘src’, links to other pages through ‘href’ and group attributing through ‘class’.<br>

                Class is one of the most important attributes as it can be used to assign styling from CSS to every element that has the same class attribute, which prevents repeatedly writing the same CSS for every element that needs the styling.<br>

                All HTML documents contain a similar base layout which consists of a starting tag which tells the browser to render the page as a HTML document and then a html tag which contains a head and body tag.<br>
                The header tag is used to contain unseen content such as: page title, search engine optimization and links to CSS files. While the body tag is used to contain all of the visible page content.

                <div class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html> &lt;html> &lt;head>&lt;/head> &lt;body>&lt;/body> &lt;/html></div>

                HTML is limited in what it can do as it is primarily static and requires the help of Javascript in order to give it dynamic functionality. It also requires a new HTML document for every page meaning that even if all of the elements are the same, it will need a new document to change page, which can be taxing to create.<br><br>

                <img class="left" src="icon/essayimgs/css.png" alt="css" draggable="false">
                
                The second language that is used in frontend development is CSS and stands for cascading style sheets and is used solely for styling elements inside of a HTML document. CSS was developed by the aforementioned W3C in 1996 due to html not being a fit language to have tags that format the page as this type of tag required web developers to have to rewrite each HTML document every time a new styling tag was introduced throughout each HTML version. CSS isn't a requirement for websites unlike javascript and HTML but without the use of CSS, websites would look plain and empty due to the lack of positioning and colour. The idea for CSS was first brought up by Håkon Wium Lie on the 10th of October 1994 <span>'during his time working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN'<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="No information given">[?]</a></span> but the first version was only released in 1996 <span>'but then enhanced upon in CSS 2 from 1998'<a href="https://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/years/2020/projects/FinalPresentations/HTML/historyofcss.html" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="No information given">[?]</a></span>.
                The advantages of CSS become very noticeable from both a developers and users point of view when comparing websites with and without, as if you take this website without CSS:<br>

                <img class="left" src="icon/essayimgs/nocss.png" alt="no_css" draggable="false">

                You might have seen a website display itself like this when it fails to load completely, and thus had to reload the page due to a lack of cohesion in the tall list of links, buttons and images all consisting of only blue and black text. All websites would have this same list-like layout and sizing if not for the use of CSS attached to the main HTML document. CSS has a much higher efficiency than the styling used in HTML 3.1 as assigning an element in HTML to a class allows for CSS to style every element of the given class without having to rewrite the code for every element you want to style which only requires one declaration statement. Unlike HTML, CSS lays out its code by containing the style for an element in a pair of curly brackets which is placed after the element you want to style such as:

                <div class="code">p{ Background-color: red; }</div>

                By using ‘p’ it tells the CSS code to style every paragraph element in the HTML document with a background colour of red. However if you wanted to style a certain class rather than every element of a specific tag then you would want to have the class name rather than the tag of an element placed before the curly brackets with a period placed in front.

                <div class="code">.className{ Background-color: red; }</div>

                Now, rather than styling all the elements of a specific tag; only the class called ‘className’ will have a background colour of red. The same goes for if you want to style an element with a certain ID name, all you would need to do is place the id name of the element before the curly brackets with an octothorp placed in front: 

                <div class="code">#idName{ Background-color: red; }</div>

                With the ability to style all elements of a certain tag, class and id all through css it allowed for the CSS code itself to be kept in a separate file rather than having to be stored in the HTML ‘style’ tag. This meant that not only would you not have to write the same styling code for every element you want it to apply to; but also that you wouldn't need to rewrite all of the code for every HTML document you wanted it to apply to as it could now easily be linked into the page using a ‘link’ tag:

                <div class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="[file name]"/></div>

                Through the advent of being able to have one CSS file to style every page of a website, the use of CSS has become more of a requirement than an optional addon to HTML.
                Although even with the advent of a single css file, many types are still used to fit a certain purpose of a website. These types of CSS are called External, Internal and Inline.<br>

                CSS used as an internal style is loaded each and every time the website is refreshed or reloaded and can also only be used for the HTML document that this CSS code is written on, This is due to this specific CSS code being contained inside of a HTML documents ‘style’ tag rather than externally contained in a separate CSS file. Internal CSS has a benefit when developing a site compared to an external file due to having all of the styling and HTML code on one page makes it easier to view and share previews for the page being developed.<br>

                Secondly, CSS used as an external style is usually considered the most convenient as it uses the aforementioned separate CSS file, meaning it can be used on every page without having to rewrite the code for every page, which can increase the speed of styling and adding new pages to a website. This method also has the advantage of possibly improving the load times for a website as rather than having to read a new stylesheet inside of each HTML file, it can instead read the external CSS file being kept in the ‘browsers cache’ (small storage containing data from previously visited websites in order to load them faster) which allows for much faster loading of the CSS.<br>

                Finally, inline CSS is used for styling single elements in HTML documents through using the style attribute inside of an element and is laid out in the form: 

                <div class="code">&lt;[tag name] style=”background-color: red;”> [content of element] &lt;/[tag name]></div>

                This method of CSS is not generally considered to be the most efficient method, however can be useful to change styles of a single element quickly for preview purposes when creating a website.<br><br>

                The third and final language that is used in frontend development is Javascript, Brendan Eich invented Javascript in 1995 for use in the Netscape 2 web browser <span>'before becoming the ECMA-262 standard in 1997'<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_history.asp" target="_blank" class="sourcer" name="No information given">[?]</a></span>. Javascript was later handed over to ECMA by Netscape and now continues to be developed by the Mozilla foundation who are best known for their Firefox browser.<br>

                Javascript is a high level language used in websites due to its ability to allow dynamic interactions inside of a webpage that HTML and CSS cannot offer by themselves. Javascript can edit styles and add actions based on user inputs onto the site.<br>
                Similarly to CSS, Javascript can be stored either on the page in a ‘script’ tag, or in a separate JS file linked to the page:

                <div class="code">&lt;script src="[file location]">&lt;/script></div>

                Unlike with HTML and CSS, Javascript has many libraries developed for it in order to add new functionality that base javascript does not include. These additions allow previously long lines of code to be simplified for example:

                <div class="code">document.getElementsByTagName(‘div’);</div>

                from base Javascript can be turned into:

                <div class="code">$('div')</div>

                In the JQuery library.<br>
                The interactivity that this code can supply makes a static website using only HTML and CSS into a more fleshed out experience for the user by adding functions such as: onClick(), onLoad() and onChange(). These are used to call functions when one of these conditions are met within the page. These can be laid out in two ways, in the javascript file itself:

                <div class="code">variable.addEventListener(‘click’ function(){ output code });</div>

                Or within the HTML document as an attribute:

                <div class="code">&lt;[tag name] onClick=’function(){ output code }’>&lt;/[tag name]></div>

                Both examples show javascript ‘events’ that allow for specific tasks such as dropdown menus, button functionality and for starting different CSS animations.
                Frontend javascript can also be used for hidden uses to improve a websites functionality such as loading images when needed, adding cookies to a page so the user can stay logged in and for preloading certain elements to improve website speed between pages.<br>

                Javascript is good at these operations due to its speed and simplicity as Javascript executes its code inside the browser rather than connecting to a server or needing a compiler for it to run. Due to these benefits, Javascript is incredibly popular and therefore has a lot of user created libraries and tutorials for beginners wanting to get into the language.<br>
                However even with all these benefits of Javascript, the language still has some issues as each browser can interpret the code differently meaning that some features that work on one browser may not act the same on a different browser, which ends up requiring a developer to test the code on all of the major browsers before being able to upload the code for the website.<br>
                It is important when coding in Javascript that the variables are assigned before the code itself is referenced due to the language processing the code from the top down. This means that if a function is referenced before the variable is assigned in the code, then the variable in the function will be read as ‘undefined’ which prevents the rest of the code from being executed.
